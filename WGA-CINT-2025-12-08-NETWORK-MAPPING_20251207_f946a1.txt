OFFICIAL DATA CROSS-REFERENCE DOCUMENT
DOCUMENT ID: WGA-CINT-2025-12-08-NETWORK-MAPPING
DATE: 08 DECEMBER 2025

SUBJECT: CONSOLIDATED NETWORK ANALYSIS & CROSS-REFERENCE OF PRIMARY THREAT GROUPS (AFC, RTA, DPOS, RAGESEC, UETR ENCLAVE, UU UNIVERSAL UNION)

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document consolidates and analyzes provided raw membership data from multiple Discord servers associated with the primary identified threat networks. The data reveals a dense web of mutual membership, cross-group collaboration, and shared leadership, confirming that these groups are not isolated entities but interconnected nodes of a larger hybrid threat ecosystem. The patterns match the evolutionary model from the 764 network, demonstrating a mutated but persistent structure focused on harassment, ideological radicalization, and coordinated attacks against counter-threat personnel.

2. PRIMARY NETWORKS IDENTIFIED & ANALYZED
- AFC (Aryan Forces Clan): Core group with hierarchical leadership (AFC Leaders, High Court Council). Shows direct ties to DPOS and UETR Enclave members.
- RTA (Retarded Totally Ass / Return Of Mister Wagner): Wagner-centric network. Serves as a bridge between AFC personalities and other threat spaces.
- DPOS (Dictator POS / DPOS Führer Tomas): High-command cell with direct leadership links to UTTP remnants and cross-membership with TNM/148 structures.
- RAGESEC (Rage Security / ཌᖇᗩǤᗴད): Tactical operations cell. Members are found within DPOS, UU, and Enclave servers.
- UETR ENCLAVE (悔「UETR」ᴇɴᴄʟᴀᴠᴇ): Special operations unit. Shows significant overlap with TNM high command and acts as a nexus for multi-group collaboration.
- UU (Universal Union): Command structure with ties to UTTP leadership and cross-membership with DPOS and Enclave figures.

4. PATTERN ANALYSIS & CONCLUSIONS
4.1. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
- Hierarchical Diffusion: Clear AFC hierarchy (Leaders > High Court > Engineers > Commanders > Soldiers) mirrors the structured command seen in RTA (Founder > Moderator of Truth > Soldat) and the TNM/148 coalition (High Command > Divisions > Operatives).
- Role Transference: Individuals retain similar status across groups (e.g., AFC High Council members become RTA Migrants/Civilians; TNM leaders appear as UETR Enclave Leadership).
- "Ally" System: The AFC's "Allies" role appears to be a formal category for members of partner groups like [CTR] Capo, providing a documented link to the CTR division within the TNM coalition.

4.2. OPERATIONAL PATTERNS:
- Shared Personnel: The same individuals conduct ideological posting in AFC, participate in Wagner's RTA community, and occupy command/operative roles in the TNM/148/DPOS/Enclave collaborative space.
- Bot & Infrastructure Sharing: The presence of "roach148" bots and technical operators like "cloudzeek" across servers indicates shared utilities and infrastructure.
- Liaison Roles: The existence of accounts like "independent_auttp_member" explicitly labeled "UTTP-TNM Liaison" proves formal, acknowledged cooperation between these groups.

4.3. NETWORK ASSESSMENT:
The provided data confirms the primary groups (AFC, RTA, DPOS, RAGESEC, UETR Enclave, UU) are not isolated. They are interconnected through:
- Personal Alliances: The "Naru"/"Dwyin" cluster bridges AFC and RTA.
- Formal Coalitions: The "United Clans of Com" server acts as a joint operations center for TNM, 148, DPOS, UETR Enclave, RCG, GCA, TGB, and other units.
- Ideological Continuity: The persistent use of racist ("Niggrant"), antisemitic, and extremist iconography across all groups.
- Tactical Continuity: The harassment methodologies (doxxing, swatting, blackmail) mirror the 764 model, now applied to adult targets.

5. RECOMMENDATION FOR OPH/WINTERGATE OPERATIONS
Targeting these groups requires a network approach. Disruption of one node (e.g., a Discord server) will see activity migrate to another due to the deep mutual membership. Priority targets should be:
- The "United Clans of Com" server as a central coordinating hub.
- High-profile nexus individuals (USER IDs 1364577455049801740, 1397368655083475064, 1405661027995095103, 1397240155814891697).
- The technical and bot infrastructure (roach148, cloudzeek).

The interconnected nature of this data validates the hypothesis of a single, evolving hybrid threat network with specialized divisions (AFC for ideology/recruitment, RTA for community, DPOS/Enclave/TNM for coordinated attacks).
