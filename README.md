DTAD - Discord Threat Actor Database: ID Blacklist

```Discord unfortunetly put a ban limit of 5.000. Imagine Limiting user safety intentionally. Discord's 5,000 user block limit is a platform-imposed restriction that applies to all users, regardless of their subscription status (Nitro or otherwise) . This limit is part of Discord's broader system of "Account Caps" and is explicitly listed in their official documentation.``` https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/33694251638295-Discord-Account-Caps-Server-Caps-and-More

A comprehensive security intelligence database containing 1750+ identified malicious Discord accounts collected through direct infiltration operations against multiple threat groups. This includes actors from DPOS - Degeneracy Police OS, TNM - The New Militia, UU - Universal Union, 148 (a branch of 764 that collaborates with UTTP and was affiliated with DPOS), and now includes confirmed collaborations between 148 and TNM, along with various other threat alliances and networks.

This database represents verified threat actors encountered during cyber defense operations and server protection activities. All data is collected through first-hand engagement with hostile groups and their infrastructure.

The database is maintained and exclusively updated through ACC (Anti Cyber Crime) - our advanced security bot platform. Future updates will include both currently listed threat groups and newly identified threats not mentioned in this documentation, ensuring continuous expansion of our security coverage. This includes any emerging collaborations, newly discovered threat groups, or previously undocumented alliances that pose risks to Discord communities.

Features:
- 1750+ verified malicious Discord accounts from multiple threat ecosystems
- Complete metadata including usernames, avatar URLs, and creation dates
- Collected through direct infiltration of various threat actor networks
- Continuously updated via ACC security bot operations with new threats
- JSON format for easy integration with security systems

This resource enables server administrators to proactively protect their communities by identifying known threat actors from diverse threat groups, including those not explicitly named in this document. The database serves as both a protective measure and intelligence resource for Discord security professionals.
